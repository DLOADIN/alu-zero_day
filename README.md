# ALU Zero Day - Version Control Project

This repository contains comprehensive documentation and exercises on **version control**, with a particular focus on **GitHub** and other **distributed version control systems**. The project includes bash scripts designed to help you practice essential version control tasks, from initializing repositories to branching and merging.

## Overview

The **ALU Zero Day** project is aimed at introducing version control systems, especially **Git**, and demonstrating how to use **GitHub** for managing repositories. It provides clear explanations of distributed version control systems (DVCS), their benefits, and practical use cases. Additionally, the project includes bash scripts to practice common version control tasks.

## What is Version Control?

**Version control** is the practice of managing changes to code, documents, or other information over time. It allows teams to collaborate effectively, maintain a history of changes, and roll back to earlier versions when necessary.

### Types of Version Control
- **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)**: A single, central repository that holds all the files. Example: **Subversion (SVN)**.
- **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**: Each user has a full copy of the repository, allowing them to work independently and then synchronize changes. Example: **Git**.

### Key Concepts
- **Repository**: A storage location for the version-controlled files.
- **Commit**: A recorded change to the repository.
- **Branch**: A parallel version of the repository for working on separate features.
- **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches.
- **Pull Request**: A request to merge changes from one branch into another.

## Features

1. **Version Control with Git**:
   - Learn how to initialize and manage repositories with **Git**.
   - Commit, clone, pull, push, and merge changes.
   - Manage remote repositories using **GitHub**.

2. **Distributed Version Control Systems**:
   - Understand how DVCS works and why it is beneficial for collaborative projects.
   - Work independently on different parts of the project and then synchronize changes.

3. **Bash Scripting Exercises**:
   - Practice common version control commands through exercises written in bash scripts.
   - Automate tasks such as initializing repositories, committing changes, and pushing to remote repositories.

4. **Best Practices for Version Control**:
   - Use branching strategies like **feature branching** and **GitFlow**.
   - Write clear and concise commit messages.
   - Handle merge conflicts effectively.

## Technologies

This project makes use of:
- **Git**: A distributed version control system.
- **GitHub**: A web-based platform for hosting Git repositories.
- **Bash**: For scripting and automating version control tasks.

## Version Control Exercises

1. **Initializing a Repository**:
   - Learn to create a local repository using the `git init` command.
   - Practice adding files to the repository and making the first commit.

2. **Cloning and Remote Repositories**:
   - Use `git clone` to copy a repository from GitHub to your local machine.
   - Configure remotes with `git remote add`.

3. **Branching and Merging**:
   - Create and switch between branches with `git branch` and `git checkout`.
   - Practice merging changes from different branches using `git merge`.

4. **Pulling and Pushing Changes**:
   - Fetch and integrate changes from a remote repository with `git pull`.
   - Push local changes to a remote repository using `git push`.

5. **Resolving Merge Conflicts**:
   - Learn how to resolve merge conflicts when they arise during the merge process.

### Example Bash Script for Version Control:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init my_project

# Navigate to the project folder
cd my_project

# Create a README file
echo "# My New Project" > README.md

# Add files to the repository
git add README.md

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit with README"

# Add a remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my_project.git

# Push the changes to GitHub
git push -u origin master

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/DLOADIN/alu-zero_day.git
